# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Description:

This project predicts whether a student will PASS or FAIL based on study habits and attendance using Python & Machine Learning.

 Features:

 Dataset with study hours, prep score, attendance, assignments, sleep hours, and extra classes.

 Trained 3 ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network.

 Compared accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report of each model.

 Visualized feature importance using Random Forest.

 Plotted ROC Curve for performance evaluation.

 Added recommendations for students predicted to fail.

 Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLPClassifier)

 Usage:

Input student’s data → get Pass/Fail prediction

Receive suggestions to improve performance if failing.
